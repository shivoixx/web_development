      scoping and conditional statement(if-else, switch) in JavaScript

      //Scoping is determining where variables, functions, and objects are accessible in your code during runtime. This means  the scope of a variable(where it can be accessed) is controlled by the location of the variable declaration.
      // In Javascript, there are two scopes:
      // Global Scope
      // Local Scope
      var string1 = "This is a string."; //global scope
      console.log(string1);

      let a = "43"; //global scope
      console.log(a);

      // "{}" it is called block. if we define variable in this block than the variable is only useable in this block not out of it. which is known as local scope.
      {
        let a = "26";
        console.log(a);
      }

      console.log(a); //here it used the global scope "a", bcz it is out of the block.

      //constant variables
      const c = "this cannot be change";
      console.log(c);

      //conditional statements.
      //1) if-else statement-
      let age = 34;
      if (age > 18) {
        console.log("can be vote");
      } else {
        console.log("you cannot be vote");
      }

      //2)Switch case staement-
      const cups = 42;
      switch (cups) {
        case 4:
          console.log("the value of cup is 4")
          break;
        case 41:
          console.log("the value of cup is 41")
          break;
        case 42:
          console.log("the value of cup is 42")
          break;
        case 43:
          console.log("the value of cup is 43")
          break;
      
        default:
        console.log("the value of cup is none of 4,41,42, and 43.")
          break;
      }
